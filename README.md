# Flutter Switch Display

I saw [this tweet](https://twitter.com/FlutterDev/status/1139200781905727489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) and thought 
the switch display was cool.

View the switch display on 
[DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/a3f0ac68217dc53668fd54a8e328e3bf) (use Chrome). 

To enable Flutter native OSX desktop app support, follow [these instructions](https://flutter.dev/desktop#set-up).

To run the code as a native OSX desktop app, 
use: ```flutter run -d macOS```
