# message_display

I saw this display and I thought it was cool:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have surpassed 50K followers on Twitter!<br><br>Three cheers for our Flutter Community who have made the dream a reality.<br><br>Stick around for more updates, news, protips, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WidgetoftheWeek?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WidgetoftheWeek</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BoringShow?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BoringShow</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FlutterFriday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FlutterFriday</a>. <a href="https://t.co/AQCIl8rbM3">pic.twitter.com/AQCIl8rbM3</a></p>&mdash; Flutter (@FlutterDev) <a href="https://twitter.com/FlutterDev/status/1139200781905727489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

I wanted to see how hard it would be to do in Flutter. It is very reasonable.
